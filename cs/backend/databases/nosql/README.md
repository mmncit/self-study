A Key-Value Store is a flexible NoSQL database that's often used for caching and dynamic configuration. Popular options include DynamoDB, Etcd, Redis, and ZooKeeper.

## Etcd

Etcd is a strongly consistent and highly available key-value store that's often used to implement leader election in a system.

## Redis

An in-memory key-value store. If memory crash, loose data
fast, best-effort caching solution
used to implement rate limiting

## ZooKeeper

ZooKeeper is a strongly consistent, highly available key-value store. It's often used to store important configuration or to perform leader election.
