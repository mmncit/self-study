## What problem is Cassandra trying to solve?

Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database management system that was designed to solve the scalability and availability issues faced by traditional relational databases. Specifically, it was designed to handle the big data and real-time demands of modern applications.
Cassandra was built to address the following problems:

- **Scalability:** Cassandra was designed to scale horizontally, which means it can distribute data and processing across many commodity servers, allowing it to handle large amounts of data and traffic.
- **High availability:** Cassandra was designed to be highly available, meaning it can continue to operate even if some nodes in the cluster fail.
- **Fault tolerance:** Cassandra was designed to be fault-tolerant, meaning it can continue to operate even if there are network partitions, hardware failures, or other types of failures.
- **Real-time performance:** Cassandra was designed to provide high performance for read and write operations, making it well-suited for use cases that require low latency and high throughput.
- **Flexibility:** Cassandra's flexible data model allows for the storage of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and use cases.
  Overall, Cassandra provides a scalable, highly available, fault-tolerant, and flexible database solution for modern applications that need to handle large amounts of data and traffic while maintaining low latency and high throughput.

## Cassandra VS MongoDB:

Cassandra and MongoDB are both NoSQL database management systems, but they were designed to solve different problems.
Cassandra was designed to solve the following problems:

- Scalability
- High availability
- Fault tolerance
- Real-time performance

MongoDB, on the other hand, was designed to solve the following problems:

- Flexibility: MongoDB's flexible document data model allows for the storage of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and use cases.
- Ease of use: MongoDB is relatively easy to use and has a user-friendly query language.
  Developer productivity: MongoDB is designed to help developers be more productive by providing features such as automatic sharding, replication, and indexing.

Cassandra was designed to handle big data and real-time demands of modern applications that require high scalability, availability, and fault tolerance, while MongoDB was designed to provide flexibility, ease of use, and high developer productivity.
