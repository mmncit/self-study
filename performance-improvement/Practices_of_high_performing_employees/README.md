## Three keys: Talent, motivation, and support

Performance is always a function of three things. Number one, **it's a function of talent**. Do we have the requisite skill to compete at the highest possible level?

Number two, performance is always a function of motivation.
Do people want to work hard? **Are there incentives to work hard?** Do they have **ownership** of what's going on around them? Do they feel like they are part of the team? Those motivational devices will help people feel good about plugging into work and doing a good job.

And the third part, the most significant part, is the **support function**. So do people have the tools they need, the information they need, the required access, and the technology they need to compete at the highest possible level? Do they need the tools that they need to perform their job effectively?

Those three things work constantly, and it's a great diagnostic tool for improving performance. And if you look at the excellent organization out there, they make sure they hire people with talent and help people up gun their skills all the time. They create a motivational environment where people are engaged and have ownership; they have skin in the game and typically reward high performance, and they want to provide the support necessary for people to compete at the highest possible level.

## How leaders cultivate high performance

High performers have the ability and the **tenacity to create focus**. So they create a focus for themselves, like what they need to work on. They create focus for their people with a clearly-defined mission, and then they take that mission and they **break it down into individual job responsibilities**. So part one is they create focus. Then they **have a scorecard or metrics to keep people focusing on the right things**.

Part two is to prepare people for battle. They take time and effort to make sure there's a plan for getting it done and processes in place to support that plan. They ensure that the people reporting to them have the tools, talent, technology, and techniques necessary to succeed at what they do.
