## Top 4 Lessons learned from book -365 DAYS WITH SELF DISCIPLINE

### 1. Self Discipline Is Hard

Self-discipline means living your life the hard way: resisting temptations and instant gratification to receive bigger and better rewards in the future. It's certainly easier to avoid discomfort and indulge yourself whenever you want. Still, in the end, all you get from that approach is a fleeting pleasure now at the expense of your future, which otherwise could have been much better.

**Example:** Imagine someone who is trying to lose weight and get fit. They know that they need to eat healthy foods and exercise regularly to achieve their goals, but they find it difficult to resist the temptation of unhealthy foods and sedentary activities that provide immediate pleasure. They may tell themselves that it's easier to avoid discomfort and indulge themselves whenever they want. Still, they also know that this approach will ultimately prevent them from achieving their long-term goals of being healthy and fit.
By indulging in unhealthy foods and avoiding exercise, they may experience fleeting pleasure in the moment, but they are sacrificing their future well-being and happiness. On the other hand, if they prioritize their health and make the necessary sacrifices to eat healthy foods and exercise regularly, they may experience discomfort and difficulty in the short-term. Still, they will ultimately achieve their long-term goals and be happier and healthier in the future.

### 2. One Decision Can Set A Wrong Precedent

It takes only a moment to make the wrong choice and jeopardize your future. What feels like an insignificant decision today can have a great, lasting impact on your future. Each choice sets a precedent, and when you make the same wrong choice several times in a row, it becomes your standard [modus operandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi).

**Example:** Imagine someone who has just started a new job and is asked to work on a project that goes against their ethical beliefs. They are faced with choosing to either compromise their values and work on the project or refuse and potentially risk their job.
At the moment, it may feel like a small decision to go along with the project, but the impact of that decision could have lasting consequences on their future. By compromising their values, they could set a precedent for future ethical compromises in their career, damaging their reputation and limiting their future job opportunities.
Each choice sets a precedent for future decisions, and by making the same wrong choice several times in a row, they risk normalizing that behavior as their standard modus operandi. On the other hand, by making the difficult but right choice to refuse the project, they set a precedent for standing up for their values and principles, which can positively impact their future career and personal life.

### 3. Setup Systems For Self Discipline

Prepare yourself for difficult situations by putting up roadblocks ahead of time when your resolve is being tested. Your self-control system will do some of the heavy lifting for you, leaving your reserves of self-discipline to be used for unplanned situations when they arise.

**Example:** Imagine someone who struggles with impulse control, particularly when spending money. It is often made impulsive purchases that they later regret, leaving them feeling stressed and overwhelmed.
They put up roadblocks ahead of time to prepare themselves for difficult situations and curb their impulsive spending habits. They remove their credit card information from online shopping sites, unsubscribe from marketing emails that tempt them to buy, and set a budget for discretionary spending.
By doing this, they are creating a system that will help them resist temptation when it arises. Their self-control system will already be activated, making it easier for them to say no to impulse purchases. This approach allows them to conserve their self-discipline for unplanned situations when they need more control.
While it may take some effort to set up these roadblocks and create a system of self-control, it can ultimately lead to more financial stability and less stress in the long run. By planning and overcoming obstacles to impulsive behavior, they are setting themselves up for success and making it easier to stick to their goals.

### 4. Everyone Is Struggling

Behind the scenes, everyone struggles in some areas of their lives. While external circumstances can affect you, whether or not they control your life depends on you. Just like James Allen said, "when you achieve self-mastery, no one (and nothing) will have the power to enslave you."
